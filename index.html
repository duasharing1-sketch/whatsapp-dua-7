This powerful dua is for both protection and healing from:

— *Hasad* (envy)
— *Al-‘Ayn* (evil eye)
— *Sihr* (black magic)

It calls on Allah by His Names:

— *Ash-Shaafi* (The Healer)
— *Al-Hafiz* (The Protector)
— *Al-Qawiyy* (The All-Strong)
— *Al-Waliyy* (The Protecting Friend)

Whether the harm is physical, emotional, spiritual — or hidden — Allah is sufficient for us. His protection leaves no trace of their effects.

As Allah says in the Qur’an:

“Hasbiyallāhu la ilāha illa Huwa, ‘alayhi tawakkaltu, wa Huwa Rabbul-‘Arshil-‘Azīm.” “Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god but He. In Him I place my trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.” (Surah At-Tawbah 9:129)

*Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs, the best protector, and the best helper against those who have harmed us with Hasad (envy), Al-Ayn (the evil eye), or Sihr (black magic). Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Shaafi (O He Who Cures), Ya Hafiz (O  Preserver), Ya Qawiyy (O All Strong), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), grant us all a complete and thorough cure from all forms, and every effect of envy, the evil eye and black magic. Surround us with Your unmatched and all-encompassing protection. Strengthen us with Your divine safeguarding, ensuring no trace of their effects may touch us or cause us distress. Keep us perpetually under the shade of Your mercy and protection. Indeed, You are the Most Merciful and the bestower of blessings.*
