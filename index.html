Pause for a moment, turn your heart sincerely toward Allah, and read this short duʿāʾ for healing and protection from envy, the evil eye and black magic. Then forward it to 5 people to earn ongoing reward and duʿā.

*Niyyah*:

I intend this recitation of this du'a for myself, the compilers, the sharers, and the recipients.

*The Duʿāʾ*:

Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs, the best protector, and the best helper against those who have harmed us with Hasad (envy), Al-Ayn (the evil eye), or Sihr (black magic). Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Shaafi (O He Who Cures), Ya Hafiz (O Preserver), Ya Qawiyy (O All Strong), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), grant us all a complete and thorough cure from all forms, and every effect of envy, the evil eye and black magic. Surround us with Your unmatched and all-encompassing protection. Strengthen us with Your divine safeguarding, ensuring no trace of their effects may touch us or cause us distress. Keep us perpetually under the shade of Your mercy and protection. Indeed, You are the Most Merciful and the bestower of blessings.

Because of the niyyah, when others recite this after you share it, you are included in their duʿāʾ. They will be praying for your healing and protection from envy, the evil eye and black magic too.

This is 1 of 23 supplications from *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings*.

*Take a few seconds now and forward this to at least 5 people* — so the reward of spreading goodness increases for you, and duʿāʾs continue to be made for you with every sincere recitation.
