This powerful dua is for both protection and healing from:

— *Hasad* (envy)
— *Al-‘Ayn* (evil eye)
— *Sihr* (black magic)

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs, the best protector, and the best helper against those who have harmed us with Hasad (envy), Al-Ayn (the evil eye), or Sihr (black magic). Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Shaafi (O He Who Cures), Ya Hafiz (O  Preserver), Ya Qawiyy (O All Strong), Ya Waliyy (O Protecting Friend), grant us all a complete and thorough cure from all forms, and every effect of envy, the evil eye and black magic. Surround us with Your unmatched and all-encompassing protection. Strengthen us with Your divine safeguarding, ensuring no trace of their effects may touch us or cause us distress. Keep us perpetually under the shade of Your mercy and protection. Indeed, You are the Most Merciful and the bestower of blessings.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
